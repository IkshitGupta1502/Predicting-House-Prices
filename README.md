# Predicting-House-Prices

**Introduction**

Accurately estimating house prices is essential for buyers, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions. This project utilizes a dataset of over 21,000 real estate transactions from 2010 to 2024 to predict house prices, considering factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, condition rating, year built, and location (zip code).

**Project Overview**

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to provide insights into the main factors that influence home values. Key technical aspects include:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, dimensionality reduction, and data transformation.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location.
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
- Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and model performance visualization.

**Importance and Applications**

House price prediction models play a crucial role in:
- Buyer's Guide: Getting a fair deal on a house.
- Seller's Tool: Arriving at a competitive price for their property.
- Investor's Insight: Pinpointing undervalued assets in growth areas.
- Policymaker's Aid: Creating housing policies that advance affordability and stability.

**Methodology**

- Data Collection: A dataset of over 21,000 real estate transactions was obtained.
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and structured properly.
- Feature Engineering: Key features were extracted.
- Model Evaluation: Machine learning models were trained and evaluated.

**Results**

The results provide deep insights into the main factors that influence home values. The research corroborates that machine learning and statistical modeling make significant gains from traditional pricing methodologies.

**Next Steps**

- Incorporating Additional External Factors: Economic indicators, school district ratings, crime rates, and infrastructure developments.
- Advanced Machine Learning Models: Experimenting with GBM and Neural Networks.
- Geospatial Analysis: Implementing GIS mapping.
- Time-Series Forecasting: Conducting time-series forecasting.

**Technical Details**

- Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
- Model Performance Visualization: Visualizing model performance using various metrics.
